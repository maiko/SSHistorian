# SSHistorian: Security Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation about SSHistorian's security model, covering various aspects of how the application protects data, prevents common vulnerabilities, and implements secure coding practices.

## Contents

### [Sanitization Approach](./Sanitization_Approach.md)

Covers how SSHistorian sanitizes user input to prevent injection attacks and other security issues:
- Context-aware sanitization strategies
- SQL injection prevention
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- Input validation techniques

### [Permission Model](./Permission_Model.md)

Details the permission model used to control access to files and data:
- File system permissions
- Database security
- Path security mechanisms
- Access control approach
- Temporary file security

### [Encryption Implementation](./Encryption_Implementation.md)

Explains how SSHistorian implements encryption to protect sensitive session data:
- Hybrid encryption approach (AES-256-CBC + RSA)
- End-to-end encryption workflow
- Key management
- Database integration
- Security measures

## Security Principles

SSHistorian follows these core security principles throughout its implementation:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Restricting operations to minimum necessary access
3. **Fail Closed**: When in doubt, deny access or operation
4. **Complete Mediation**: Validating all access attempts
5. **Security by Design**: Security integrated from the beginning, not added later

For questions or concerns about SSHistorian's security features, please contact the project maintainers or open an issue on GitHub.
